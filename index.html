	<h3 class="about">About</h3>
		
	
	<p class="bio">I'm Shemona, a curious college student looking to dip my toes into as much as I can.
	I've spent the past years studying computer science and digital media, eager to apply what 
	I've recently learned along with all that I've picked up in self-education. The endless urge 
	to learn everything I possibly can keeps me constantly motivated to complete any task at hand.
	I can offer a variety of skills, including sharp problem solving capabilities and an 
	exquisite writing style. I have built this website as a navigation for all the projects
	I have completed for my web design class. The main web design class website is accessible 
	<a href="http://class.ideabasin.com/">here&#8599;</a>.</p>

	<h3 class="portfolio">Portfolio</h3>
	<p class="aboutportfolio">Our final project consisted of building a portfolio to house our best work.
	This was not limited to the class, it simply had to be a collection of whatever
	you felt best described your talents. We first created wireframes 
	(<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Portfolio%20Wireframe%201.jpg">Wireframe 1&#8599;</a>, 
	<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Portfolio%20Wireframe%202.jpg">Wireframe 2&#8599;</a>, 
	<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Portfolio%20Wireframe%203.jpg">Wireframe 3&#8599;</a>).
	Then, we made styleboards (<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Portfolio%20Styleboard%201.jpg">Styleboard 1&#8599;</a> and 
	<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Portfolio%20Styleboard%202.jpg">Styleboard 2&#8599;</a>)
	to showed the basic design of the site. For my portfolio I decided to include
	the four talents that resonate most with me: Computer science, digital arts,
	writing, and innovation.</p>

	<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/resume/"><img src="images/resume.JPG" alt="resume website"></a>
	<p class="title">Resume</p>
	<p class="description">Here, I've designed a simple, one page layout of my resume. The goal
	was to make it clean and easy to use, specifically for potential employers.
	I used only two colors for the entire site, and switched them before and after
	the anchor scroll to change the design look, but keep the style.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/recipes/"><img src="images/recipe.JPG" alt="recipe website"></a>
	<p class="title">Recipe Book</p>
	<p class="description">This website was to showcase a certain set of recipes that may hold 
	some importance to you. I chose to go with the theme of "What Can I Do With...?"
	In order to give users a way to discard foods that they want to use up.
	We first created a <a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Recipes%20Wireframe.jpg">wireframe&#8599;</a>, 
	one <a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Recipe%20Book%20Styleboard%201.jpg">styleboard&#8599;</a>, and then a 
	second <a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Recipe%20Book%20Styleboard%202.jpg">styleboard&#8599;</a>
	to ensure we covered a wide range of styles.</p>

	<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/heroes/index.html"><img src="images/heroes.JPG" alt="heroes website"></a>
	<p class="title">Heroes</p>
	<p class="description">Heroes was built to showcase the people that I admire. Everyone included
	in this website have shaped my view on the world in one way or another and 
	have truly inspired me to live a better life. This project started off 
	with a <a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Heroes%20Wireframe.jpg">wireframe&#8599;</a>, 
	followed by one <a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Heroes%20Styleboard%201.jpg">styleboard&#8599;</a>, a second
	<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Heroes%20Styleboard%202.jpg">styleboard&#8599;</a>, and a third 
	<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Heroes%20Styleboard%203.jpg">styleboard&#8599;</a>.</p>

	<p class="title">Definitions</p>
	<p class="description">For this project we were given a word to build a website upon. It
	needed to be only one page, however the goal was to make the website
	have some functionality that would represent the word. This could be
	through color or animation</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/how-to/"><img src="images/how-to.JPG" alt="how-to website"></a>
	<p class="title">How-To</p>
	<p class="description">For my How-To project, I did a walk-through of how to write the
	word "happy" in my language of Hindi. I wanted to make it almost like
	a lesson, where users could easily access a menu containing the steps
	in case they needed to go back to a step.</p>

	<div>
	<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/poem-1.0/"><img src="images/poem1.JPG" alt="poem1 website"></a>
	<p class="title">Poem 1.0</p>
	<p class="description">This was the main, in-depth version of the poem project we had been working on, 
	We had to plan out the website first on paper, including the creativity we
	had before but still adding onto the charm.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Poem0.4.html"><img src="images/poem0.4.JPG" alt="poem0.4 website"></a>
	<p class="title">Poem 0.4</p>
	<p class="description">For this project, it was time to create an entirely new layout for
	our poems.We had to utilize the border-box model, percentages, both block and
	inline elements and position and float properties.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Poem0.3.html"><img src="images/poem0.3.JPG" alt="poem0.3 website"></a>
	<p class="title">Poem 0.3</p>
	<p class="description">This was simply a clean-up of our previous project. The intention was
	to make the website more responsive and interactive using the new
	information we learned in class.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Poem0.2.html"><img src="images/poem0.2.JPG" alt="poem0.2 website"></a>
	<p class="title">Poem 0.2</p>
	<p class="description">After we had learned how to add some CSS elements to our website,
	the purpose of this project was to add some style to our previously
	created Poem 0.1.</p>
	</div>
	
	<div>
	<a href="http://class.shemona.ideabasin.com/projects/Poem0.1.html"><img src="images/poem0.1.JPG" alt="poem0.1 website"></a>
	<p class="title">Poem 0.1</p>
	<p class="description">Being this was the first project, it was a simple site that projected
	our favorite poem or song lyrics, in just a plain black-and-white html
	page. </p>
